### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m Manuel, Full Stack Developer Jr ðŸš€ My main language is Javascript (MERN). Passionate about web technology, I have decided to expand my previous background in advertising art direction ðŸ‘€ and graphic design towards a total immersion in the digital environment ðŸ“²

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning everything related to clean and efficient code. Also, opening new horizons like Vue.js.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about photography, design or pottery. I really love them. 

ðŸš€ This is my [CV](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuel-chapela-33b84780/detail/overlay-view/urn:li:fsd_profileTreasuryMedia:(ACoAABE11R8B6jyTkFnXLFaxhexuOfQ5iSEeKPY,1635459932177)/)
